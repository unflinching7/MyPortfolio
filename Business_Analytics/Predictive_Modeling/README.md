# Group Project: Credit Risk Assessment in the German Banking Sector

## Overview
This project focuses on credit risk assessment in the German banking sector, emphasizing the unique cultural and regulatory factors that shape financial practices. By leveraging machine learning models, the study aims to improve loan default predictions and support informed lending decisions.

## Key Highlights
- **Goal:** Enhance credit risk assessment by addressing challenges specific to the German financial landscape.
- **Data:** Analysis performed on the German Credit dataset using machine learning techniques.
- **Models Used:** Logistic Regression, Neural Networks, Decision Trees, and Naïve Bayes.
- **Findings:** Neural Networks outperformed other models, particularly in terms of recall, providing the most accurate predictions of high-risk borrowers.
- **Recommendations:** Tailored strategies to manage credit risk, including attribute-specific assessments and updates to reflect economic changes.

## Recommendations for Credit Risk Management
- Incorporate cultural and regulatory nuances into credit scoring models.
- Emphasize key factors such as checking account status, loan purpose, and credit amount in assessments.
- Utilize model stacking (e.g., combining Neural Networks with Naïve Bayes) to improve transparency and performance.

## Limitations and Future Research
- **Data Constraints:** Dataset size and timeliness may limit model predictions.
- **Proposed Enhancements:** Use larger, more recent datasets and incorporate additional data sources like transaction histories.
- **Future Focus:** Explore evolving creditworthiness, economic cycles, and customer behavior trends.

## Conclusion
The project demonstrates the value of machine learning in credit risk assessment, with models like Neural Networks offering robust solutions for identifying high-risk borrowers. These insights can help German banks reduce loan defaults, improve profitability, and contribute to a healthier financial landscape.
