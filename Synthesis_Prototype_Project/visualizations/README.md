# README.md for Visualizations Folder

## Overview
The **Visualizations** folder contains graphical representations of insights generated by the **Chiropractic Scheduling and Management System Prototype**. These visualizations help highlight key findings related to scheduling inefficiencies, unmet demand, and revenue impacts, providing actionable insights for decision-makers.

## Contents
### 1. availability_trends_heatmap.png
- **Description:** A heatmap showing predicted availability trends across different time slots and days of the week.
- **Purpose:** Identifies high-demand time slots and days, helping to optimize staffing and scheduling.
- **Key Insights:**
  - Darker areas indicate higher availability.
  - Lighter areas indicate higher demand, requiring additional resources.

### 2. missed_opportunities_bar.png
- **Description:** A bar chart depicting the number of missed scheduling opportunities by the day of the week.
- **Purpose:** Highlights the impact of unmet demand across the week.
- **Key Insights:**
  - Certain days, such as weekends, have significantly more missed opportunities.
  - Provides actionable data to adjust staffing levels and improve resource utilization.

## Importance
These visualizations are integral to the project's goal of optimizing multi-location chiropractic scheduling. By transforming complex predictive data into easy-to-interpret graphics, they empower stakeholders to make informed decisions about staffing, resource allocation, and scheduling adjustments.

## Usage
- Included in the **presentations** folder for stakeholder communication.
- Demonstrated in the project's video presentation as evidence of the system's analytical capabilities.
