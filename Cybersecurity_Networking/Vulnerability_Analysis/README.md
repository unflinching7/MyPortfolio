# Wireshark Network Analysis Project

## Overview
This project showcases the use of Wireshark for network analysis, including identifying protocols, capturing packets, and analyzing network traffic. The objective was to gain insights into network operations, understand vulnerabilities, and explore methods to mitigate risks.

## What Was Done
### Network and Protocol Identification
- **Packet Capturing:** Used Wireshark to capture packets in real-time by selecting the appropriate network interface (e.g., Ethernet) and applying filters.
- **Filters:** Applied display filters (e.g., `dns`, `http`) and capture filters (e.g., `port 1812` for RADIUS) to focus on specific traffic.
- **Traffic Analysis:** Analyzed traffic distribution using Wiresharkâ€™s statistics tools (e.g., `Statistics > Conversations`).
- **Reconstruction:** Reconstructed specific conversations using the "Follow TCP Stream" feature to analyze protocols such as HTTP, DNS, Telnet, and SSH.

### Protocols Identified
- **Non-encrypted Traffic:**
  - RADIUS (port 1812)
  - HTTP (port 80)
  - DNS (port 53)
  - Telnet (port 23)
- **Encrypted Traffic:**
  - SSH (port 22)
  - HTTPS (port 443, over TLS)

### Packet Analysis
- Used Wireshark tools to inspect packet details, visualize traffic trends, and identify potential vulnerabilities, such as unencrypted credentials in HTTP Basic Authentication and Telnet sessions.

### Attack Surface and Indicators
- Identified the attack surface:
  - Open ports and services (e.g., HTTP, Telnet).
  - Unencrypted traffic (e.g., HTTP, Telnet).
  - IoT devices with potential vulnerabilities.
- Indicators of potential cyber-attacks:
  - Repeated failed authentication attempts (e.g., brute force).
  - Unusual traffic patterns or anomalies.

## Results
### Protocols and Traffic
- Successfully captured and analyzed traffic for:
  - HTTP (GET and POST requests).
  - DNS queries and responses.
  - Telnet (plain-text communication).
  - SSH (encrypted sessions).
  - RADIUS authentication traffic.

### Cyber-Attack Analysis
- No specific cyber-attacks were identified during the capture, but future use includes monitoring for:
  - Scanning behavior (e.g., consistent attempts to connect to closed ports).
  - Large unexpected data transfers.
  - Malformed or anomalous packets.

---

## Key Learnings
### Insights Gained
- **Packet-Level Visibility:** Wireshark offers deep insights into individual packets and protocol layers.
- **Protocol Analysis:** Differentiating between encrypted and non-encrypted traffic helps identify vulnerabilities.
- **Attack Surface Understanding:** Recognized the importance of minimizing unencrypted traffic and monitoring open ports.
  
### Future Use
- Regular monitoring to ensure compliance and security.
- Using Wireshark for incident response and detailed traffic analysis.
- Employing Wireshark in security audits to identify vulnerabilities.

### Organizational Value
Wireshark provides actionable insights to:
- Detect and respond to potential threats.
- Identify vulnerabilities in unencrypted protocols.
- Improve network security measures through proactive monitoring and traffic analysis.

## Conclusion
Wireshark is a powerful tool for network analysis, enabling detailed packet inspection and traffic monitoring. Its use in identifying vulnerabilities and securing network communications highlights its importance in ensuring organizational cybersecurity and operational integrity.
