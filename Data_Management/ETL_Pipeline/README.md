# Comprehensive Data Engineering and Analysis: Case Studies in Health and Education

## Overview
This repository showcases a data engineering notebook with two case studies:

1. **Health and Nutrition Analysis (NHANES Dataset):** Focused on data cleaning, transformation, and trend analysis of health markers.
2. **Web Scraping and OER Analysis:** Highlights web scraping and integration techniques to analyze faculty participation in Open Educational Resources (OER).

These projects demonstrate the application of data engineering and analysis techniques to extract actionable insights and support informed decision-making.
